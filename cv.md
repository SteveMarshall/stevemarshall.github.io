- **Created the Hosting group and scaled from nothing to 5 product
  teams comprising 70 staff across 3 locations** to deliver two hosting
  platforms: a modern Kubernetes-based hosting platform on AWS, and a
  cloud hosting platform for legacy services in AWS and Azure,
  including setting product and technical strategy.
- **I set the [Ministry of Justice's hosting
  strategy](https://mojdigital.blog.gov.uk/2018/10/15/how-were-making-our-hosting-simpler-more-cost-effective-and-more-modern/).**
  As part of this, we are moving around 500 user-facing services to
  cloud-native hosting. So far **this has saved £10m** over three years,
  and because of being able to close contracts as they end, is predicted to
  save a further £30m/year over the next 5 years.
- **Ensuring delivery of high quality infrastructure products and services**
  underpinning those 500 user-facing services, including mentoring
  teams in site reliability engineering, automation, and DevOps
  practices.
- **Managing, coaching, and mentoring lead architects and engineers** to
  ensure high quality engineering practices are embedded across MOJ.
- **Engaging with stakeholders** to ensure their needs are met, while
  also working with them to improve their teams' engineering practices
  and quality.
- Managing a **budget of ~£25m/year** and contracts with ~30 suppliers,
  ensuring value for money while delivering our strategy.

## Other interests

- I am currently **building prototypes of two iOS apps** (using Swift,
  SwiftUI, and UIKit) because I have long been interested in iOS app
  development, but have only recently come up with product ideas that
  piqued my interest. The first uses OCR and machine learning to allow
  users to collaboratively curate a cloud-synced index of content.
  The second allows users to annotate and otherwise prepare collections
  of images to train CoreML object detection models with CreateML.
- I **speak at technology conferences**. Notable
  talks include ["Don't Touch the
  Monolith"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47vCm9FA1Lg) at [O'Reilly
  Software Architecture London
  2016](https://conferences.oreilly.com/software-architecture) and ["We
  Can Mirror It for You Wholesale"](https://vimeo.com/108353428) at
  [WXG 2014](https://wxg.co.uk)
- I am **one of the original developers of [Spacelog](http://spacelog.org/)**,
  a site for exploring the stories of early space exploration from the
  original transcripts. I also led **development
  of tools to ensure offline access to multiple terabytes of tools and
  data** to ensure that teams could be productive
  with no access to the Internet. Spacelog was built at a
  [`/dev/fort`](http://devfort.com/): a **week-long product development
  retreat in an isolated, iconic location**. I also attended four other
  forts, resulting in tools to help cooks, a
  [habit-forming service](https://github.com/devfort/behabitual-static),
  an [offline Twitter clone](https://github.com/devfort/bugle) and
  [terminal client](https://github.com/devfort/conch), and
  [voting tools](https://github.com/devfort/turnout-election-schemes).
