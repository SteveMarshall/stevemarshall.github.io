## Other interests

- I am currently **building prototypes of two iOS apps** (using Swift,
  SwiftUI, and UIKit) because I have long been interested in iOS app
  development, but have only recently come up with product ideas that
  piqued my interest. The first uses OCR and machine learning to allow
  users to collaboratively curate a cloud-synced index of content.
  The second allows users to annotate and otherwise prepare collections
  of images to train CoreML object detection models with CreateML.
- I attend and speak at technology conferences. Notable
  talks include ["Don't Touch the
  Monolith"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47vCm9FA1Lg) at [O'Reilly
  Software Architecture London
  2016](https://conferences.oreilly.com/software-architecture) and ["We
  Can Mirror It for You Wholesale"](https://vimeo.com/108353428) at
  [WXG 2014](https://wxg.co.uk)
- I have taken part in five [/dev/forts](http://devfort.com/):
  the most successful product we have built is
  [Spacelog](http://spacelog.org/), a site for exploring the stories
  of early space exploration from the original transcripts.
