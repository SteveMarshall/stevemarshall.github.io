title: Tired of this phase
---
[Ben][Ben Ward] has publicly [challenged himself][Ben Tired of this
phase] to not waste his pre-work mornings by sleeping through multiple
alarms.

Whilst I don't intend to mimic his goal (I already get up at 6:30am
thankyouver'much), I have a habit of not doing things (posting here,
writing for [Web Typography][], exercising, and the list goes on) for
similar reasons. I bemoan a lack of time, a fear of failure, a lack of
knowledgeâ€¦ Anything, in fact, to excuse myself from doing things that
might challenge me and require me to put effort into something.

So, to echo Ben's sentiment:

> This week, I'm taking the "don't be so pathetic" method to not being
> shit at stuff.
