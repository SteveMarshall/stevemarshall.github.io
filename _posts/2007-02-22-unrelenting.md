Where did the last six months go?

It doesn't seem like it was that long ago that I was [getting excited][Camp] in the build-up to [Reading][], [BarCampLondon][], and [d.Construct '06][] (all three of which were incredibly fun).

Since then, I've managed to get a job at [Yahoo! Europe][] as a web developer, become a regular at [Pub Standards][], [launch a new design][Happy New] for this site (and let it languish, despite my best intentions), and attend a [second BarCamp][BarCampLondon2], as well as going to various gigs (to name but a small fraction). 

I had thought that I'd experience a quick flurry of activity before things returned to normal. How wrong I was: my definition of normal has been altered to include working with some of the [best][Norm], [brightest][Tim], and [most influential][Chris Kaminski] people I could ever care to work with, having an influence on potentially thousands of people's browsing experiences, almost 4 hours of commuting every day (most of which is spent on public transport), and a general feeling of awe at everything my life has become in this short period of time.

Everything seems to be happening at an unrelenting pace now: [SxSW07][SxSW07] is just around the corner, [@media][] won't be far behind that, with d.Construct '07 sure to follow. BarCamps will probably be plentiful this year, too, and I'm going to try to go to [Reading][] again, as well as (hopefully) taking an [Outward Bound 'adventure'][Outward Bound]. Because of this I'm making loads of new friends and seeing old ones more often, too.

I'm busy as hell, but I couldn't be happier.
