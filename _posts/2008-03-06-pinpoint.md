For those of you that haven't seen it already, go look at [Fire
Eagle][]. Do it now.

Good, innit?

For those of you that don't quite get it, the point is that it's a
central location-brokering service. You tell Fire Eagle where you are
(or set your devices and [web apps][Dopplr] to tell it), and other
applications can, if you allow them, use that data in fun and
interesting ways (think auto-geo-tagging of photos on flickr, or mapping
where your friends are, to name the most obvious).

Anyway: Fire Eagle really caught my attention and, thanks to my
friendship with [the lovely Mr. Coates][Tom Coates], I got to play a
little with its API before launch. Whilst it's not _quite_ finished yet
(the methods to find users of your application within a given area,
`within`, and to find recent location updates from your users, `recent`,
are not there at the time of writing), the API and, indeed, website are
decidedly lovely.

The website is friendly, playful, and takes all the hard edges off of
the concept of using a web app whose sole purpose is to serve other
applications and widgets. It has non-awful markup and CSS (although
there are a few things I might quibble with in a code review). The URLs,
thoughâ€¦

Oh, the URLs! Whoever came up with the idea of allowing
`http://fireeagle.com/my/location/is/Austin%20TX` (or, indeed, any other
location, but Austin, Texas is [particularly apt][SXSW 08] for me right
now) is an evil genius after my own heart.

[The API][Fire Eagle API] has had as much care and attention as the web
interface, though: no method is out of place, everything accepts what
you'd expect. What's more, it uses [OAuth][] for authorising third-party
applications to access user data (and Fire Eagle allows you to specify
what level of granularity you want to allow per-application), so even
_that_ is positively simple given the existence of libraries to deal
with OAuth for you.

If it all _still_ seems like too much hard work to implement bindings
for the API in your app, that's been covered, too: there are bindings
for [Javascript][fe JS binding], [PHP][fe PHP binding], [Ruby][fe Ruby
binding], [Perl][fe Perl binding], and even one for [Python][fe Python
binding] written by yours truly.

I intend to spend a sizeable chunk of my time over the next few weeks
playing with Fire Eagle, both updating my Python API binding and hacking
around with various ideas I've had for fun, useful little apps using
Fire Eagle data.

Now, where was I?
