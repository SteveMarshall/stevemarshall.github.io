I’m spending 6 months this year on shared parental leave looking after
my new son. [Read about my experience of SPL on the Civil Service
blog](https://civilservice.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/23/shared-parental-leave-a-dads-experience/).

> ## What is shared parental leave?
>
> SPL was introduced in April last year. It allows parents to share
> maternity or adoption leave between them ([and soon, it will be
> extended to allow sharing with
> grandparents](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-announces-major-new-extension-of-shared-parental-leave-and-pay-to-working-grandparents)). Sir Jeremy Heywood intends SPL to help the Civil Service become
> one of the most female-friendly employers in the country and [make
> childcare a parental issue rather than one just for
> women](https://civilservice.blog.gov.uk/2015/04/07/shared-parental-leave-more-options-for-parents/).
>
> With [maternity leave](https://www.gov.uk/maternity-pay-leave), new
> mothers are entitled to 52 weeks of leave. For up to 39 weeks, they are
> entitled to statutory maternity pay. Many employers pay enhanced
> maternity pay, with some (including the Civil Service) offering 26
> weeks or more at full pay.
>
> Under SPL, mothers are still required to take two weeks' maternity
> leave after the birth, but the remainder can then be used as SPL. The
> parents can share their leave however they choose, in up to three
> blocks each. They can also share the salary entitlement, choosing who
> receives pay when.

> Our first child was born this January and we decided to share all our
> leave equally. My partner took two weeks' maternity leave, I took two
> weeks' [paternity leave](https://www.gov.uk/paternity-pay-leave), and
> we are each taking 25 weeks' SPL.
>
> We heard that the first three months with a new baby were the hardest,
> so decided to take three months together directly after our son's
> birth. I then returned to work for three months while my partner looks
> after him alone. In mid-July, when he is six months old, my partner
> will go back to work and I will take a further three months off to be
> the stay-at-home parent.
>
> For the last three months, my partner and I looked after and got to
> know our son together. The first few months are an amazing time and I
> feel very lucky to have had the pleasure of seeing my son change day by
> day.
>
> The turbulent early weeks were less stressful than we anticipated
> because neither of us had to be up for work in the morning and could
> share the load during the night.
>
> Being home for an extended period meant I was able to take care of my
> partner while she recovered from the birth, freeing her from the
> day-to-day things (like cooking for herself) that might be more
> difficult under the pressure of looking after our son on her own.
>
> I've been able to do everything for him (even feeding him when my
> partner expresses milk), meaning I'm just as competent at caring for
> him as she is. Because we have equal experience looking after him, each
> of us is confident we can leave him with the other without worry or
> stress.
>
> ## The challenges we’ve faced
>
> SPL is relatively new, so taking advantage of it was difficult at
> times. The paperwork can be cumbersome and sometimes doesn't fit with
> the actual policy. For example, taking time off at the same time as my
> partner, directly after paternity leave, wasn’t handled by the software
> our HR department use, making it harder to arrange. Since coming back
> to work, I’ve been working with HR to be sure others don’t have this
> sort of problem.
>
> It’s also not yet very common, though more people are taking it up (the
> recently reported [figures stating that only 1% of men have taken it
> are, in fact, wrong](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b075thgl) - they
> refer to all men of working age, not new fathers), so HR departments
> should be better-equipped to deal with it in future.
>
> I’m fortunate that my manager has been incredibly supportive. Even so,
> returning to work has been hard. It feels like I'm starting again, at a
> new job, yet where all the faces are familiar. I'm sure many women
> returning from maternity leave feel this way, but it isn't something
> I've experienced before.
>
> ## The next stage
>
> I'm back at work for three months now, and then have three months being
> the primary carer for my son.
>
> For my next block of leave, I'm nervous about being the only dad at
> activities: there are lots of mum-and-baby groups out there, but dads’
> groups are still relatively rare. I've already experienced nursery and
> health professionals talking only to my partner, even when I was
> holding the baby. Stay-at-home dads and SPL are helping to reduce this
> kind of ‘gendering’ of parenting. Hopefully, it'll soon be a thing of
> the past!
>
> It's been wonderful to spend this time with my son, and I'd strongly
> recommend expectant parents to consider taking Shared Parental Leave
> and benefiting in the way we have.
>
> More people are eligible for SPL than you might expect. [You can check
> if you are eligible on
> GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/shared-parental-leave-and-pay/eligibility).
