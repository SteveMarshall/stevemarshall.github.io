title: Happy New
---
Since the day it was launched, [nascentguruism][ng] was forsaken. When I
started designing it, I had a limited understanding of design and so
faced a massive learning curve. Because of this, most of my efforts went
into working out how to translate the concepts and feelings I wanted to
convey into a working site, along with understanding how to achieve what
I wanted in the tools I was using (Photoshop).

In hindsight, it's entirely logical that the first version of
nascentguruism's design would turn out to be everything I made it and
nothing I wanted it to be: I was learning about design by observing and
experimenting, and so would quickly lose focus on the overall design,
becoming preoccupied with whatever details I wanted to introduce at that
moment in time.

After ten months' toil, the site [launched with a whimper][launched]
and, because of the shoehorning that had taken place to include all the
extra details, I quickly became jaded: the format of the site didn't
appeal to me, and so I was unwilling to write. As time passed, my
interest waned.

## Lather, Rinse, Repeat

Shortly after [SxSW][SxSW06] in March--around June, if memory serves--I
was inspired to play with some ideas for a redesign of nascentguruism.

Rather than pressuring myself to continue working solidly until it was
ready to launch--as I had with the initial ten-month design--I decided
simply to get all my ideas down <del>on paper</del> <ins>into a
PSD</ins> before taking time to mull over what I'd come up with. After a
while, I'd start anew, creating a design from scratch, building
upon--or, in some cases, replacing--what I'd done in the last iteration.

This process continued until mid-October, when I finally felt that the
design could go no further without transitioning to markup. Throughout,
I refused to do any work--design or markup-- unless I was compelled to
do so.

I think this relaxed approach to the design and implementation has
served me twofold: the design and implementation was less forced, and so
the final site has a more relaxed, open feel to it, and this design is
something I positively want to work with, to the point that I'm
practically *itching* to post new content to it (and have been for the
last month). Further, the iterative, throwaway-prototype approach to
designing allowed me to incorporate new ideas effectively, without
compromising the design as much as I might before.

### Typography

One of my primary focuses in this new design was to experiment with
typography, using some of the ideas gleaned from reading Robert
Bringhurst's '[The Elements of Typographic Style][Elements]' and working
with [Rich][Rich Rutter] on [Web Typography][]. I've tried to blend more
widely used ideas (like working with [vertical rhythm][wt §2.2.2] using
[baselines][]) and more playful ones (like [ornamented indentation][wt
§2.3.2]), and will continue to experiment and integrate ideas put forth
in Web Typography.

Some of these experiments are very reliant on using modern CSS
techniques, such as [generated content][] and [pseudo-elements][] and,
as such, may not display as expected on all browsers (Internet Explorer,
I'm looking at *you*). Further, most of the font-size-related typography
has been optimised for WebKit-based browsers on Mac OS X and, as such,
there may be sizing issues with other platforms or browsers. Or maybe
not. Everything should be *usable*, at the very least.

### Style

As it stands, the CSS is very clearly showing signs of the hap-hazard
approach I took to developing it; in the very near future, I plan to
rework it--possibly using [YUI][YUI] [reset][YUI reset] and [fonts][YUI
fonts].

## Support

I couldn't have achieved everything I have in this redesign if it
weren't for the help of a two notable individuals:

* [Anton][Anton Peck] was a constant source of inspiration and has the
  patience of a monk, answering all my design questions--no matter how
  inane--with nary a complaint.
* [Ben][Ben Ward] put up with my badgering for opinions on this or that
  markup quandary, and seemed to delight in challenging me to get the
  ideal markup working in whatever layout I was attempting.

These two deserve more gratitude than I can express here--or in beer
form--thank-you both.

There are, however, others that have supported me throughout the
process, who also deserve thanks:

* [Drew][Drew McLellan]
* [Faruk][Faruk Ateş]
* [Fatty][David Thompson]
* [Fran][Frances Berriman]
* [Norm!][Mark Norman Francis]
* [Piotr][Piotr Gajos]
* [Rich][Rich Rutter]


## *Fin*?

nascentguruism is far from complete--during this redesign, I've come up
with many, many ideas for future work on the design and implementation.
Most importantly, however, I have a renewed excitement for blogging and
a few ideas for future posts in mind.

Only time will tell if it lasts, I suppose.
