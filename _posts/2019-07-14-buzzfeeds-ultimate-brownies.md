title: BuzzFeed's ultimate brownies, in metric
---

I really like [BuzzFeed's ultimate brownie recipe](https://www.buzzfeed.com/marietelling/heres-exactly-how-to-make-the-best-brownies-of-your-life),
but every time I make it, I find myself doing mental gymnastics to
convert from American measurements (cups and sticks) to real (metric)
measurements. To save myself that difficultly next time, I decided to
convert it once and for all, and publish it here.

> ## Ingredients
> - 284g unsalted butter, plus more, softened, for greasing
> - 227g good-quality semisweet or bittersweet chocolate (60-70% cacao),
>   roughly chopped
> - 128g unsweetened Dutch process cocoa powder, divided
> - 1 tablespoon espresso powder
> - 402g granulated sugar
> - 110g dark brown sugar, packed
> - 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
> - 2 teaspoons kosher salt
> - 6 large eggs
> - 128g all-purpose flour
> - Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling
> 
> ## Directions
> 
> Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350°F
> (180°C/gas mark 4). Grease a 9x13-inch dark metal pan with softened
> butter, then line with parchment paper, leaving overhang on all sides.
> Grease the parchment with softened butter.
> 
> Combine the chopped chocolate, ⅓ of the cocoa powder (43g), and
> espresso powder in a heatproof liquid measuring cup or medium bowl and
> set aside.
> 
> Add the butter to a small saucepan over medium heat and cook until the
> butter just comes to a vigorous simmer, about 5 minutes, swirling the
> pan occasionally. Immediately pour the hot butter over the chocolate
> mixture and let sit for 2 minutes. Whisk until the chocolate is
> completely smooth and melted, then set aside.
> 
> Combine the granulated sugar, brown sugar, vanilla extract, salt, and
> eggs in a large bowl. Beat with an electric hand mixer on high speed
> until light and fluffy, about 10 minutes. It will be similar to the
> texture of very thick pancake batter.
> 
> With the mixer on, pour in the slightly cooled chocolate and butter
> mixture and blend until smooth.
> 
> Sift in the flour and remaining 85g cocoa powder and use a rubber
> spatula to gently fold until just combined.
> 
> Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and smooth the top with a
> spatula. Bake until lightly puffed on top, about 20 minutes.
> 
> Remove the baking pan from the oven using oven mitts or kitchen towels,
> then lightly drop the pan on a flat surface 1-2 times until the
> brownies deflate slightly. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt.
> 
> Return the pan to the oven and bake until a wooden skewer inserted into
> the center of the brownies comes out fudgy but the edges look cooked
> through, about 20 minutes more. The center of the brownies will seem
> under-baked, but the brownies will continue to set as they cool.
> 
> Set the brownies on a cooling rack and cool completely in the pan.
> 
> Use the parchment paper to lift the cooled brownies out of the pan. Cut
> into 24 bars and serve immediately.
