Just a brief note to mention that I uploaded [my Django Fire Eagle authentication wrapper][django_fireeagle] to [Google Code][].

It uses (and complements) [my Fire Eagle <abbr title="Application Programming Interface" class="caps">API</abbr> binding][fireeagle_api] to wrap up the process of authorising your Django application with Fire Eagle into little more than pointing your users at a <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator" class="caps">URL</abbr> and setting them free.
