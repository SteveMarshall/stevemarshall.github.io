Just a brief note to mention that I uploaded [my Django Fire Eagle
authentication wrapper][django_fireeagle] to [Google Code][].

It uses (and complements) [my Fire Eagle API binding][fireeagle_api] to
wrap up the process of authorising your Django application with Fire
Eagle into little more than pointing your users at a URL and setting
them free.
