Apparently, [Elly tagged me][Elly source] with this 'where was I?' meme, so I suppose I ought to follow it up:

##Where was I… one year ago?##
This time last year, I was working with [Ben][] at [Fujitsu Siemens Computers][FSC]. As Ben [noted][where Ben was], we would have been working on a Microsoft-SharePoint-based document management system. Unfortunately for Ben and I (and our other team-mate, Steve Hayter, who appears to have fallen off the face of the earth), we had short deadlines and large workloads. 

As such, we were working long hours on hard problems, pushing one another to our mental limits. I recall one week in particular that I worked something in the region of seventy hours in five days. As one could imagine, trying to push my friends to work this way was a double edged sword: I wanted the work to be done, but I also didn't want to have to make Ben and Steve do the stupid hours it would require.

##Where was I… five years ago? (or 'How to make Steve feel old')##
It took me a while to work this one out, but it seems that five years ago I would have been coming to the end of my first year at [university][UniS]. I'd met a bunch of people I now feel privileged enough to call my closest friends, spent lots of time avoiding work, and generally doing what university students do (well, other than the getting dangerously drunk part).

##Where was I… ten years ago? (or 'How to make Steve feel _really_ old')##
I was coming up to the ripe old age of fourteen and would have been in year nine at [Mill Chase Community School][Mill Chase], four months from starting my <acronym class="initialism" title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">GCSE</acronym>s. I wasn't big but, for my age, I might have been clever.

##Who am I tagging?##
* [Jon][]
* [Paul][]
* That's it: I'm lazy.
