title: Carson Workshops Summit
---
Another month, another conference booking. This time, [~~The Boy
Wonder~~<ins>Ben</ins>][Ben Ward] and I will be attending the
[Carson Workshops Summit][] on the 8th of February, 2006, with [~~The
Joker~~<ins>Fatty</ins>][Fatty Thompson] in tow.

Rumour has it that [Jeremy][Jeremy Keith], [Andy][Andy Budd],
[Richard][Richard Rutter], and [The Jon][Jon Hicks] will be there, not
to mention the speakers: [Mister Mint][Shaun Inman], [a Signal]
[David Heinemeier Hansson], and [someone predictable][Ryan Carson], to
name but a few.

Add to that the fact that it's Ben's birthday the day after, and it
should make for an altogether good day/evening.
