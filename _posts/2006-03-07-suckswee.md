Apparently it's nearly time for [Fatty][] and me to make our way to
[SXSWi '06][SXSWi06]. Tomorrow (Wednesday) morning, we'll be leaving my
house at some ungodly hour and heading to Gatwick, to fly with
[Continental][] to Austin, via Houston.

As Fatty [mentioned][Fatty SXSWi], we'll probably be spending some of
the flight working out how we're going to spend our time in Austin.
Thanks to the wonders of [SiteSucker][], I have details for all the
goings-on throughout the week direct from the SXSW site and loaded onto
my iBook. The only certainty at this point is that we plan on spending
Monday night [fiddling with some shiny balls][bowling] with the likes of
[The Molly][Molly] (who is our team's official cheerleader, apparently),
[Faruk][] (our team captain), [Da Keith][] (a team-mate), and
[many][Scrivs], [many][Mike Davidson] [more][Dave Shea].

If you're going to be at Suckswee, take a look at my [about page][],
remember my face, and either try to avoid me like the plague (which I'd
heartily recommend, if you value your sanity) or grab me and say 'hi'.

I'd prefer the latter.
