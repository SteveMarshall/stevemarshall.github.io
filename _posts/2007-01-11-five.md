title: Five

How, exactly, does one write a post that purports to list 'five things
*you* don't know about me'?

No matter how it's written, *someone* out there will probably already
know most--if not all--of the items (hi, Mum!). Should it be written for
[the person][Sarah Blow] [asking the question][Sarah Blow tagging], in
which case it might be a different list to that offered to new friends
which, in turn, might be different to that offered to fresh visitors
from search engines. Maybe I'm just over-thinking the whole thing.

To make this a little more interesting (for me, at least) I'm going to
change the game a little and write in detail about one thing (and one
that I often have to explain, at that), along with a shorter list of a
further four things.

## Non-alcoholic

For seven years or so, I've abstained from drinking alcohol. 

Yes, you read that correctly: a 24 year-old guy that doesn't drink. No
need to alert the media.

On a friend's birthday (I believe it was his 18th), all those years ago,
I got heinously drunk. A *bottle of Bacardi, bottle of Jack Daniels,
multiple lagers, and an amount of vodka by 10 o'clock and being unable
to recall the rest of the drinks consumed until midnight* kind of drunk.

Needless to say, I stumbled back home (which, thankfully, was just
around the corner) by about midnight and after attempting to sleep
and---being troubled by the fact that my room had, apparently, been
relocated to a turntable---decided that being violently sick with my
head down the toilet for the next six hours was a smart course of
action.

Over the next two days, I came to the conclusion that taking a break
from alcohol was a good idea. I never intended this break to last very
long--much like anyone with an awful hangover--but I held out for a week
or two. The next thing I knew, it was a year later and I was telling
this story to new friends at [university][UniS]. 7 years on, and I still
don't drink.

I'm often asked if I miss it, or if I'd consider drinking again. I've
certainly thought about drinking again, but every time I find myself
wondering exactly what I'd gain from it. Who knows: maybe one day I'll
give drinking another try.

## …and the rest

* I wasn't always a rabid [Apple][] fan: there was a time that I
  ridiculed a [clamshell-iBook][]-toting friend for his 'toy' computer,
  with its one-button mouse. It took membership---and ultimately
  becoming an Admin---at [Aqua-Soft][] to turn me into the Apple-lover
  I am today.

During this time, I made an [iTunes skin for Windows Media Player
9][iTunes WMP9]. And then Apple released [iTunes][] for Windows about 2
months later. And then [I finally got a Mac of my own][PowerMac
arrival]. [And another][iBook arrival]. [And another][MacBook Pro
arrival] (although, technically, that's a machine owned by Yahoo!).

* Climbing is the only sport that I have any interest in. I haven't
  done any outdoor climbing yet---much to my chagrin---and have always
  been tempted to go on an [Outward Bound 'adventure'][Outward Bound
  course] but haven't managed to… yet.
* Thanks to my GCSE in Art (or rather, my GCSE Art teacher), I found
  myself unable to draw, design, or even so much as *doodle* until I
  was at university (thanks, in no small part, to design blogs). Even
  now, I find it hard to do (but I'd like to think that I'm getting
  better at design).
* I *adore* food and cooking. Flavours and the science of food---and
  their application---are an eternal source of interest for me. I could
  happily spend days investigating and experimenting in the kitchen. I
  doubt I'm particularly *talented*, but I'd like to think I can at
  least cook *well*.

## Pass

Rather than passing this on to [the][Ben Ward] [usual][Frances Berriman]
[suspects][David Thompson] (who are, incidentally, *very* suspect---and
welcome to take this as passing to them, if they like), I thought I'd
try to pass this on to a different bunch:

* [D. Keith Robinson][]
* [Dan Rubin][]
* [John Oxton][]
* [Jon Hicks][]
* [Norm!][Mark Norman Francis]
