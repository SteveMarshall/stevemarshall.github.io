Well, it's finally here!

After 10 long months, countless hours slaving over HTML and CSS, and
more procrastinating than even I would have thought possible,
nascentguruism is finally a real website!

First and foremost, I'd like to thank [Ben][] for all his help and
support. Were it not for his inspiration, assistance, and, frankly,
constant whinging that I just needed to get on with my site and get it
live, nascentguruism wouldn't be half the site it is now. Thanks Ben, I
owe you, big-style.

So, welcome to nascentguruism, one and all. If you're interested in who
I am or how the site is made, then you probably want the [about][] and
[colophon][] pages, respectively.

A word of warning: the site is still very much a work in progress. I'm
going to be tweaking and sprucing up pretty much anything I can think of
over the coming weeks (well, from a techie perspective, at least - the
look of things should remain fairly constant). As such, if you see
something that looks a bit odd or that you think needs work, don't
hesitate to let me know, either via the comments here, or via [email][]

Update: One of the first errors I'm going to try to crack is visible on
the [about][] page for those of you using either Firefox up to 1.0.* or
Safari - if the image isn't loaded quickly enough, the CSS-positioned
corners don't end up in the right places on the page. Any suggestions
are much appreciated.

Also, if anyone uses Opera and has any idea how I can fix the fact that
it doesn't correctly handle absolutely positioned elements with `width:
auto` and `left` and `right` positions, then that would be nice.
