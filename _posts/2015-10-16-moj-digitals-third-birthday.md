In honour of MOJ Digital's third birthday, I spent some time this week
digging through our [GitHub
repositories](https://github.com/ministryofjustice) generating some
stats about everything we've built. I've [published the code I wrote to
generate the
stats](https://gist.github.com/SteveMarshall/316808849ee857d4c21f) and
written up [my findings on the MOJ Digital
blog](https://mojdigital.blog.gov.uk/2015/10/16/moj-digitals-third-birthday-3-years-and-24-million-lines-of-code/).

> MOJ Digital is 3 years old this week and has already put millions of
> lines of code into the public domain.
>
> We believe in sharing our work whenever we can, and that includes our
> code. Making this open source means we can give something back as well
> as building on the work of others.
>
> After 3 years we now have 23,712,024 lines of code on
> [GitHub](https://github.com/ministryofjustice), a code sharing service.
>
> Each line of code represents a small step towards making the justice
> system better, in services like [make a lasting power of
> attorney](https://mojdigital.blog.gov.uk/category/lasting-power-of-attorney/)
> or [book a prison visit](https://mojdigital.blog.gov.uk/category/prison-visits/).
>
> ## Crunching the numbers
>
> It was pretty easy to work out the figure on the lines of code
> using [GitHub's statistics APIs](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statistics/).
>
> For each repository, we can call the [code
> frequency](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statistics/#code-frequency)
> and [participation](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statistics/#participation)
> endpoints, which give week-by-week breakdowns of additions,
> deletions, and commits to that repository. Once we have that, it's just
> a matter of adding it all up.
>
> In the spirit of making things open (because [it makes them
> better](https://www.gov.uk/design-principles#tenth)), I’ve published
> [the code I wrote to do
> this](https://gist.github.com/SteveMarshall/316808849ee857d4c21f).
>
> ## Repositories
>
> A repository, or 'repo', contains all of the files and documents for a
> project. It also contains the revision history for each file.
>
> We have 566 repos, which contain code, documentation, and tests (and
> test data). These are all of our prototypes, live services, tools and
> websites. There are even a few things built by others which we've
> tweaked (or 'forked').
>
> The repos also include all our configuration, but this is private and
> encrypted.
>
> ## Commits
>
> A commit, or 'revision', is an individual change to a file (or set of
> files).
>
> In the last year, we made 24,435 commits.
>
> With around 40 developers, that's a little over 2.5 commits per
> developer per working day last year.
>
> It would be nice to see that number increase slightly, as it suggests
> our commits are a little larger than they should be, but it's still
> pretty good!
>
> ## Lines of code
>
> Since we started, we have:
>
> * added 58,416,839 lines of code
> * deleted 34,704,815 lines
>
> This means we currently have 23,712,024 lines of code on GitHub.
>
> Nearly 24 million seems like a lot, but this is everything we've
> built, plus a few things we've adapted.
>
> ## To the next 3 years
>
> We've done a lot in the 3 years since MOJ Digital started, but there's
> still lots more to do in digitising the justice system.
>
> Here's to the next 3 years, and the next 24 million lines!
