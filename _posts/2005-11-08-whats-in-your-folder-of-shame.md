I just noticed [<cite>Jeff Veen</cite>'s post about his <q>folder of shame</q>][jeff folder of shame] (via [Ben][ben folder of shame], surprise, surprise) and, much as I'm still very new to this here blogging malarky, I too have a folder of shame. Currently, it contains:

* Why I love my Macs
* What I want to play with or fix on my site
* Mac OS *keyboard layouts* on windows
* A post commenting on Microsoft's [Atlas][]

As I'm still pretty new to the game, my folder actually seems to contain things I'm seriously working on, but haven't yet finished. This, though, is mostly because I'm still very much trying to find my feet in the world and get the hang of writing things for <del>my mum</del><ins>the world</ins> to see.
