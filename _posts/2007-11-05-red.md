I'd been talking to John about her for quite a while before Peter
finally introduced us. Dressed in close-fitting red, subtly accentuating
her curves, she waited patiently outside.

As I approached she perked up, attentive to my presence, a youthful
exuberance in her eyes. My hand lightly touching her side, she drew me
closer. As I pushed all the right buttons, she progressed from a quiet
whimper to an excited, throaty purr.

I still don't know her name. Her number, though, is 368 of 500.[![Photos
