title: All booked up for SXSWi

So that's it - [Fatty][] and I are all booked up for our sojourn to the veritable geek-fest that is [<acronym title="South by SouthWest">SXSW</acronym> interactive][SXSWi] (which I am hereby christening 'suckswee').

We'll be be arriving in Austin at about 4<abbr title="post meridiem">pm</abbr> local time on the 8th of March 2006, having left Blighty (that's Britain for those of you that didn't know) at 9:30<abbr title="anti meridiem">am</abbr> on the same day.

We ended up getting a room together in the [Radisson][]; I know everyone says that the [Hampton Inn Downtown][Hampton] is where all the cool kids stay, but they were all booked out (save rooms with double beds, and I don't plan on sharing a bed with Fatty anytime soon). This either means that there are going to be far too many truly cool people in Austin next March, or that the Hampton booking system somehow knows when people who it deems uncool are trying to book rooms, and simply lies to them. 

I'm hoping it's the former.

We've then got a day or so either end of <acronym>SXSW</acronym> to enjoy the sights and sounds around Austin or, better yet, to get more acquainted with our fellow sucksweers, and we leave at about 4<abbr title="post meridiem">pm</abbr> local time on the 16th.

I can't wait.

<abbr title="Post Scriptum">PS</abbr>: Let me know in the comments if you're going too and we can meet up or something!

Also, recommendations for where we can go for breakfasts would be good, too, as such things appear to be unheard of in the Austin Radisson...
