When I was [progressing][Mill Chase] [through][Alton College]
[education][UniS], September was, naturally, a very busy time of year,
with new starts and changes to the way my time was squandered: more
homework, less homework, more socialising, less socialising, more free
time, less free time. Generally, Septembers would set the tone for the
rest of the year.

Since entering the real world, these flurries of activity seem to occur
far more irregularly but this year is refreshingly different, with
September being marked once more by a flurry of activity, much of which
is an indicator (hopefully) of how the coming year will shape up.

The back-to-~~school~~<ins>cool</ins> build-up starts with
[Reading][Reading Festival], over the last weekend of August. Whilst
I've been to a fair few gigs, I've never been to Reading Festival before
and I'm getting pretty excited about it now. Granted, some of the acts
I'd been hoping to see have [pulled out][Audioslave cancelled] or simply
[weren't going][The Bronx] this year, but it still looks like there's a
[decent line-up][Reading lineup].

Then we enter September, and the web-standards conference year kicks off
with a quick one-two punch of [BarCamp London][] and [d.Construct
2006][]. d.Construct 2005 was my first web-standards conference and, if
last year - along with the [line-up for this year][d.Construct 2006 lineup]
- is anything to go by, this year should be stellar.

This openness permeates every facet of the 'conference': rather than a
formal gathering at a conference venue, with all the attendees staying
in the local swanky hotel at great expense, BarCampers are expected to
bring a sleeping bag and pillow, and all find somewhere to camp at the
venue. This, to me, is incredible: I've often said (although obviously
not on nascentguruism, what with not posting much) that the biggest
reason for attending any conference is the social aspect.

Add to that the idea that first-timers are *expected* to contribute
(usually by way of presenting something or leading a discussion), and
things really start getting exciting. This entirely demolishes the
established 'get an industry figurehead to talk from a pedestal'
approach: everyone is equal, and everyone has something to contribute.

And so I've landed my first public speaking gig.
