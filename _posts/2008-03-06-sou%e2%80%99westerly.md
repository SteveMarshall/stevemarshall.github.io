Given that I'm sitting [or was, at the time of writing—<abbr title="Editor">Ed.</abbr>] in a large, metal tube at about 35,000<abbr title="feet">ft.</abbr>, and [Ben][Ben Ward] is writing for his blog, I've been gripped by the desire to write for mine, too. Miracles, apparently, will never cease.

For the third year running, now, I'm on my way to Austin, Texas for&nbsp;[<abbr title="South by South-West">SXSW</abbr>][SXSW 08].

##Past

The first year ([2006][SXSW 06]), travelling with [Fatty][] (whom I had met but once before), was an incredible experience. I got to make lots of new friends and, generally, learn a huge amount and have a brilliant time.

Fast-forward a year to [2007][SXSW 07] and Fatty and I were joined by Ben, and I got to share a room with the inimitable [Faruk][Faruk Ateş]. There were lots of complaints, from others, of the conference becoming too big for its own boots, of too many panels with too little content, and so forth; generally, there seemed to be an air of malaise about <abbr title="South by South-West">SXSW</abbr>.

Socially, for me, it was bigger and better than my first year: I went to more parties, spent time with more people, and generally made more friends than in 2006. _It was good_.

##Present

I fully expect this year to continue that trend given that, at the airport this morning, Ben and I (alas, no Fatty this year) bumped into [Stuart Colville][] _before we had even checked in_, Paul Duncan over breakfast, [Cyril Doussin][] and Tristan Turpin (who, along with Stuart, are on the same flight as Ben and me) just after breakfast, and [Gareth Rushgrove][] in the departures lounge.

All this, mark you, _before we had even left Gatwick Airport_.

Granted, this was aided in no small part by the magic of [Twitter][] (and generally being better acquainted with more people in the web scene), but there was also a certain amount of serendipity thrown in for good measure, too.

##Near-Future

Compared to the last two years, my aims have ever-so-slightly changed, too. Rather than, as last year, placing the focus on attending sessions and parties, my focus this year will simply be on "am I making the most of this time?". I intend to be rather mercenary about this, in fact: last year and the year before, there were times when I stayed at a party for fear of not knowing anyone at another. That shan't happen this year.

Further, I intend to be very much, to use an <acronym title="Neuro-Linguistic Programming">NLP</acronym> phrase, "in the moment". Also, in a change to normal programming, I shall be drinking alcohol (although hopefully not to [the levels of excess][flickr me drunk] seen at [d.Construct 07][]).

The biggest change, though, is that I shall, finally, be attending [SXSW music][SXSW 08 music]. The past two years, I've lusted after that extra week of partying and gigs (and envied [Keith][D. Keith Robinson] horribly when he's stayed on); this year, I get to partake myself (along with Ben, [Alex Lee][], and Lindsey Mooney). Not only that but, thanks to contacts in [Yahoo! Music UK][], I may have wangled access to closed recording sessions for Yahoo! Music with Ben, Alex, and Lindsey.

I'm looking forward to it all more than you can possibly imagine.
