nascentguruism was initially designed in about eight hours in Adobe [Photoshop][], before moving to a combination of [TextPad][] on Windows and [TextWrangler][] on Mac OS (along with a slew of different browsers), and finally being ported into [WordPress][]. 

As simple as it sounds, this process started on the 7th of January, 2005, and finished sometime around the 10th of October in the same year. Yes, that's 10 months and 3 days.

More details will be added here as I get the time. Who knows: this page may even expand to become a series of pages or articles.

##The name##
'nascentguruism' is a hybrid of two words:

* '[nascent][]' (pronounced <em>nay</em>&middot;sunt or <em>nah</em>&middot;sunt) &ndash; <q cite="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=nascent">Coming into existence; emerging</q>
* '[guruism][]' (pronounced <em>goo</em>&middot;<em>roo</em>&middot;ism) &ndash; the act of being a <q cite="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=guru">recognized leader in a field</q>

In short, the site's name is a tongue-in-cheek reference to the fact that, regardless of how much I try to master anything, I always find more to learn. (This is a <em>good</em> thing)

nascentguruism should always be written as one word, and with no capitals because I think they spoil the look of the word. If you don't follow the standard I set for how the name should be written, I may hunt you down and kill you in the night. Or not &ndash; only time will tell, at this point.

##Standards##
The site is coded with web standards (<acronym title="eXstensible HyperText Markup Language">xhtml</acronym> and <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">css</acronym>), and has, for the most part, content and style kept distinctly seperate (with a few choice omissions).

##Platform##
A very slightly modified version of WordPress drives nascentguruism, with a smattering of plugins, both home grown and off the shelf.

##Accessibility##
In the future, closer attention will be paid to making the site more accessible for users with special needs; the current design <em>does</em> scale quite nicely, though: press <kbd title="Control">Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>+</kbd> (<kbd title="Command or 'Apple'">Cmd</kbd> and <kbd>+</kbd> for Mac users) on your keyboard at the same time to scale it up, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>-</kbd> (<kbd>Cmd</kbd> again, Mac users) to scale it back down. Give it a try, it won't do any harm (you can always scale back down, if you don't like it, after all!).

##Typography##
nascentguruism uses (assuming you have them installed on your machine) two typefaces for all its text: Microsoft's Georgia (a font which pretty much every Windows or Mac user should have) and Agfa Monotype's Lucida Grande (for Mac users) or Microsoft's Verdana (for those users with no sans-serif version of Lucida, be it Grande or Sans).

If there were a common, web-safe sans-serif with text figures (numbers with descenders &ndash; that's typography speak for 'bits that hang under the baseline'), I'd have used that. But there isn't. So I didn't. If anyone knows of one (web-safe or otherwise) please [let me know][contact].

##Hosting##
As of it's launch, nascentguruism is hosted by the stunning [DreamHost][], whose services and pricing are incredible. I can't recommend them enough.
