##The author##
![Steve Marshall][me]
Steve Marshall is a web developer and wanna-be designer living in a little town you've never heard of near Guildford, England. If he ever grows up, he wants to be a pirate but, in the meantime, works as a code&ndash;monkey and visionary or naysayer, as the need arises, for [Yahoo!][] Europe. Prior to this, Steve studied at the [University of Surrey][UniS] (in Guildford), graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree (with first class honours, shockingly) in [Computer Science & Engineering][CSE], and worked for [Fujitsu Siemens Computers][FSC].

Steve adores music of almost any form, and can often be found making excuses to buy *just one more <acronym>cd</acronym>*. His music collection is somewhere around the 500-album mark and rising; if you ask nicely, he might suggest something for you to listen to. Steve also likes film and dead-tree-based entertainment in equal measure, with something of a penchant for the [works][discworld] of Terry Pratchett. He enjoys video games, but believes that they just don't make 'em as good as they [used to][monkey island].

Steve can usually be found (when not at work) in front of one of his [two shiny new Macs][mac photo] tinkering with <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">html</acronym>, <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">css</acronym>, or something else thats equally geeky.
