If he ever grows up, Steve wants to be a mighty pirate. Until then, he
has to make do with being a software architect. He's worked on travel
APIs, military-grade software, sites for burgeoning rock bands,
award-winning intranet portals, and a host of things between.

When heâ€™s not working or complaining [on
Twitter](http://twitter.com/SteveMarshall), he can be found listening
to music, playing videogames, taking more photos than he has time to
process, or going very fast round corners in his car. One day, he might
blog on this site again. One day.
