# About Steve Marshall

If he ever grows up, Steve wants to be a mighty pirate. Until then, he
has to make do with being a software architect. He’s worked on
government services, travel APIs, sites for burgeoning rock bands,
award-winning intranets, and a host of things between.

When he’s not working or complaining [on
Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@stevemarshall){: rel="me"}, he can be
found listening to music, playing videogames, taking more photos than
he has time to process, or going very fast round corners in his car.
One day, he might blog on this site again. One day.
